For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
I have used a naive bayes model with default parameters for the training.

## Intended Use
1. Bank professionals
2. Insurance professionals

## Factors
Most of the data points were from United Stated and Mexico

## Metrics
Classification Accuracy

## Evaluation Data
The train test split was done at 20%. So, 20% of the data was used for evaluation

## Training Data
The train test split was done at 20%. So, 80% of the data was used for training.

## Quantitative Analyses
Precision: 0.6392572944297082
Recall: 0.31056701030927836
Fbeta: 0.41803989592367735

## Ethical Considerations
Considerations should be made, so that the model is not biased towards one particular race.
